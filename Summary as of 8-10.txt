NOTES:
code refers to OUR javascript code
program refers to a user created set of blocks
bugs refers to things that break DrBlocket or greatly inhibit DrBlocket
issues refers to things such as styling that while should be fixed, hold a lower priority and does not affect useability of DrBlocket
TODO refers to things just not implemented
Please note that this is not a necessarily exhaustive list of issues
If coloring dissapears, type typeCheckAll() into the console... if color returns, a typeCheckAll is missing in the code


Completed:
	*Program renders with closed drawers, header and blank storage.
	*Drawers can be opened and closed on click.
	*Blocks can be dragged from drawers to program
	*Blocks dragged directly from drawer to storage will dissapear
	*Blocks can be sorted within the program
	*Blocks can be dragged into and out of other blocks
	*Blocks can be dragged from either the upper level program or from within other blocks to storage
	*Undo and redo will correctly re-render older or future versions of the program and storage
	*Export will correctly alert the user with racket representation of the code
	*Upon Saving a program, users are asked for a file name, alerted if the name already exists and saves the program,storage,functions and constants to local storage
	*Upon Loading a program, users are asked for a file name, alerted if it does not exist, and correctly loads the program,storage,functions and constants
	*Upon clicking "Define function", a function popup will appear
		-blocks can not be dragged into the expression until the contract is completed
		-contract name and definition name are linked
		-names of functions cannot repeat and must be valid
		-Contract types and arguments/expression types are linked
		-User defined Functions will appear in the drawers
		-User defined functions can be deleted
		-User defined functions can be modified
		-User defined functions will update within the program,storage program, function program etc. when updated or deleted
		-Users will be alerted when they try to close a function when things are blank
	*TypeChecking will occur at necessary points to color blocks correctly
	*If there is a typeChecking Error, blocks turn red and users can click (tablet) or mouseover for a message
	*Running a program can only happen when there are no errors in the code
	*Result messages will appear next to each block and can be clicked to display the result of teh block
	*If there was an error that was not type related (colors, style etc.) the error message can be displayed in the same manner as a result
	*In the event of an infinite loop, users can stop the evaluator and the evaluator will continue onto the other blocks



TODO:
	*Hook up undo and redo to define functions and constants
	*Potentially hook up export to the clipboard for easier copy and pasting
	*Define Constants
	*Hook saving and loading to wescheme along with a better dialogue box for file paths/name
	*Double check program for all major browers and tablets

KNOWN BUGS:
	*When error result messages are clicked more than once, more than one message appears.  Only occurs on returnMessage, not returnDOMElement.  Clicking outside the result box will still close the message
	*In define functions, arguments can be dragged out to the program.  This can be fixed by setting confinement.  However, this does not allow for the argument names to be trashed.


KNOWN ISSUES:
	*If the user tries to load a program with user defined functions and double clicks to edit that function, the styling can be a tiny bit off.
	*Better user alerts when the contract is not completed
