Functions contained in array formatted like:
var allfunc={}

var func={
	input=""
	output=""
	name=""
}


var colors=new Object()
colors.string=orange
colors.numbers=blue
Colored by OUTPUT type

document.write(colors.string)


function so that colors.USER_NAME=USER_COLOR


This allows each function to be placed with both its input and output types, and keep formatting
Avoids manually writing each function into HTML
Also allows user function to be easily added

Bottom row of function types will also be contained in changable array (for user structs)


*******************************************************
Contracts:
Determine number and types of inputs/output from contact
Auto-color using that
Contracts stored as an Object (name, ouput, array of inputs)
drop-down menu for input/output types, only thing typed is name (or drag type names from bottom toolbar)


******************************************************
Blocks:
Shape
	(define is square)
Possible spaces: (objects with limited input)
Store in tables
Dragability
Color-changing
Init-color saving
Output checker
Define allows multiple inputs: store inputs as an array
Conds allow variable length: store in an array

******************************************************
Sortability:
Found on internet, need to apply to each block object
