DrBlocket


The following is a structured editor called "DrBlocket", developed
during Summer 2012 at Brown University.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

For local developmental testing, run the following:

    $ racket browser-view.rkt gui.html 

This creates a temporary web server that presents gui.html and
automatically opens your web browser to the page.


Why can't we just open gui.html directly?  Because the web server
provides context necessary for cross-side communication to occur
between DrBlocket and the WeScheme evaluator: using gui.html locally
directly from a file://-based URL apparently does not allow the
browser to communicate with external resources.


For regular deployment, upload the contents of this directory onto a
web server and point your web browser to gui.html.
